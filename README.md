This expo explain how to use a look-alike model to find the target audience through similarity scores. A similarity score describes the similarity between an instance and the known good or bad instance. The model itself is a formula and can be repeatedly applied to new datasets. Previous I wrote an [article explaining the whole process](https://evaanalytics.wixsite.com/website/post/target-high-value-audience-using-look-alike-model). In this repo, I will add a choice to use R to find the most correlated variables related with postal code average spending. It is more accurate to use R to find the correlation and it is more flexible, allowing to add as many variables to test as you can.
